## Lab
Transpilation: Transforms a (potentially abstract) quantum computation to a *physical* quantum circuit that is compliant to a given quantum computer, i.e. can directly be executed by a suitable device, such as an ISA circuit
Fidelity: Layer Fidelity quantifies error rates in a circuit, and is particularly useful in understanding the overhead required to run error mitigation at utility-scale workloads.
Time-evolution circuits: Based on the Heisenberg model which is a popular model used to study magnetic phenomena and phase transitions in many-body systems
